# Laser Physics
<p align = "center"><img src = "images/ujm-radmep-logo.png"></p>

This was part of my Laser Physics course under Prof. Adriana Morana and Prof. Emmanuel Marin at [University Jean Monnet](https://www.univ-st-etienne.fr/en/index.html), as part of the [RADMEP](https://master-radmep.org) program. I was grouped with Mario and Luca for these experiments, and in this repository I put the codes I did for data analysis.
